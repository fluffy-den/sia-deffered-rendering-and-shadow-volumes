# Deferred Rendering and Shadow Volumes (OpenGL)

This project is a small lab from my first year of a Masterâ€™s degree. It implements:
- A simple forward rendering path.
- A simple deferred rendering pipeline.
- Shadow volumes in OpenGL, demonstrated on both the forward and deferred paths.
- No light clustering, tiled shading, or other light culling techniques.

The goal is to keep the implementation clear and educational rather than feature-complete.
